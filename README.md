<h1>Pathfinder</h1>
A pathfinding algorithm I made similar to BFS (According to Chat GPT)

Earlier I made a <a href="https://github.com/PixelWolf8976/bad-2D-game-engine">2D text based game engine</a> and tried making a pathfinding algorithm for the enemies. I failed, the first time I made it it was VERY slow, it took 30 minutes and 1 Gig of ram to move one space. When I tried to make it faster, it just went in a circle.<br>
I was bored one day and decided to give it another try, and I got it working! It's fast too. Only downside is you can't have any space on the map non-accessible or it will never move.<br>
It completes the map I provided in ~850 milliseconds!
